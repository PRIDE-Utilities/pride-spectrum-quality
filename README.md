# Main Features
* Data Structures to represent AminoAcids, Mass Table, etc.
* Functions to compute different Properties such as isoelectric point, retention time, sequence length and masses.
* Reference table of the main Ontology terms used in PRIDE-toolsuite. 
* General functionalities and data structures classes missing in JDK, such as: Tuple.
* General functionalities like checking email format and availability.

# The library provides four key modules:

* mol: contains classes describing entities at the molecular level, such as: amino acids, neutrual losses, peptides and fragment ions.
* gui: contains several GUI components, you can use them if you want to replicate some of the features in PRIDE Inspector.
* data: contains data structures classes are missing from JDK, such as: Tuple.
* util: contains a selection of convenient classes. For examples: for formatting protein related informations, for checking Internet availability or for verify email addresses.

**Note**: the library is still evolving, we are committed to expand this library and add more useful classes.

How to use pride-utilities
===============

# Using PRIDE-Utilities 

Here we will show you how to use the PRIDE Utilities library to calculate m/z delta and calculate theoretical mass of a given peptide.

### Calculate m/z Delta:

You can find the method for calculating m/z delta from MoleculeUtilities in uk.ac.ebi.pride.mol package. It requires four input parameters:

```java 
/*
 * sequence is the peptide sequence in String,
 * precursorMz is the precusor m/z in double,
 * precursorCharge is the precursor charge in double,
 *ptmMasses is a list of post translational modifications in double.
*/

// Direct call on the method
Double mzDelta = MolecularUtilitites.calculateDeltaMz(sequence, precursorMz, precursorCharge, ptmMasses);
```

### Calculate Theoretical Mass

You can also find the method for calculating theoretical mass value from MoleculeUtilities. It needs two input parameters:

```java
 /*
  *sequence is the peptide sequence in String,  
  *masses is a optional list array of masses you want to add as extras.
  The following lines of code shows you how:
 */

 // Direct call on the method
 double result = MolecularUtilitites.calculateTheoreticalMass(sequence, masses);

 // Tip: Take a close look at other methods within MoleculeUtilitites, you might find them useful. 
```
